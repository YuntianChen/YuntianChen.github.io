Research Vision | From Data Intelligence to Scientific Intelligence
------
My research aims to build a new paradigm of Scientific Intelligence — an AI framework that deeply **fuses knowledge and data** to enable machines not only to learn the laws of nature but also to discover them.

I strive to connect **theory, experiment, and application** through an integrated scientific learning system capable of reasoning, inference, and innovation.
The ultimate goal is to develop AI systems that act as true **“AI Scientists”**, advancing scientific discovery from experience-driven to intelligence-driven processes.

I. Knowledge–Data Integration: The Core Architecture of Scientific Intelligence
------
This research direction focuses on constructing a unified architecture that deeply integrates **human knowledge** and **data-driven learning**, enabling AI systems to learn and reason under physical principles while retaining computational efficiency and interpretability.

The framework is powered by two synergistic mechanisms:

1. **Knowledge Embedding**, which incorporates governing equations, conservation laws, and domain constraints into AI models to ensure that predictions are physically consistent, mathematically accurate, and computationally stable; and

2. **Knowledge Discovery**, which employs symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning to autonomously extract and represent governing equations from observational or experimental data.

Together, these two mechanisms form **a self-evolving architecture** that continuously bridges knowledge and data.
It breaks the traditional divide between discrete symbolic semantic space (such as equations and qualitative rules) and continuous vector feature space (such as neural representations), realizing a seamless fusion of knowledge-driven and data-driven paradigms.

As a result, this framework transforms AI models from black boxes into white boxes represented by explicit knowledge and governing equations—
achieving a new generation of **scientific machine learning models** that are physically grounded, mathematically precise, and computationally efficient.

II. AI-Assisted Fluid Mechanics: Intelligent Modeling and Aerodynamic Design
------
This research direction integrates **artificial intelligence and fluid mechanics** to develop new methods for high-fidelity, data-efficient flow modeling and intelligent aerodynamic optimization.

We focus on enabling **AI-driven turbulence modeling**, achieving high-accuracy simulations under small-sample and noisy conditions. The developed models can reconstruct fine-scale turbulent structures through super-resolution techniques and predict flow evolution over time with high efficiency and physical consistency.

In addition, my team has established an **AI-based aerodynamic design framework** that enables rapid drag prediction, pressure field estimation, and 3D vehicle shape generation and optimization. By coupling physical constraints with deep learning, this system allows end-to-end aerodynamic analysis and design iteration—accelerating innovation in vehicle design and intelligent manufacturing.

Together, these advances demonstrate how AI can serve as a bridge between physics-based understanding and engineering application, providing new tools for efficient, interpretable, and physically consistent fluid modeling.

III. Autonomous Experimental Platforms: Enabling Embodied Scientific Discovery
------
We are developing an **autonomous experimental platform** that integrates robotics, sensing, and AI decision-making to achieve closed-loop, self-driven physical and chemical experimentation.

This embodied system automates experiment design, sample preparation, data acquisition, and parameter optimization.
By coupling it with knowledge-discovery algorithms, the platform can infer new physical and chemical laws directly from experimental data.

It is more than an automated laboratory — it is a **learning experimental intelligence** capable of generating hypotheses, conducting experiments, and refining knowledge,
marking a step toward high-throughput, intelligent, and self-evolving science.

IV. Energy and Atmospheric Systems: Intelligent Forecasting for Renewable Stability and Resilience
------
This research area focuses on integrating **meteorological forecasting and renewable energy system modeling** to enhance the stability and resilience of high-penetration renewable power systems.

My team develops AI-driven frameworks for **comprehensive weather forecasting**, covering both routine atmospheric conditions and **extreme weather events** that influence renewable generation. By combining physics-informed modeling with proprietary time-series learning algorithms, our approach enables accurate short-term and ultra-short-term forecasts of wind and solar power, ensuring real-time supply–demand balance under normal conditions.

At the same time, the same framework supports **resilience-oriented forecasting**, providing early warnings and adaptive strategies to maintain system reliability and safety during extreme events such as typhoons or cold surges.

These methods have been **deployed across 16 provinces in China, covering over 100 centralized and 1,000 distributed renewable power stations**. They support operational scheduling and risk management for leading enterprises, significantly improving prediction accuracy and reducing energy loss penalties—contributing to a stable, secure, and intelligent renewable energy transition.


Future Outlook | AI as a New Engine for Science
------
My long-term mission is to advance the **intelligent transformation of science** —
connecting data, knowledge, and experimentation into a coherent ecosystem of discovery.

I envision AI evolving from a computational tool into a **collaborative scientific partner**,
capable of understanding nature, uncovering laws, and creating theories.
Through this, we can lead a new era of AI for Science, where artificial intelligence becomes a true engine of human knowledge and scientific progress.
