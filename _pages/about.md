Research Vision | From Data Intelligence to Scientific Intelligence
------
My research aims to build a new paradigm of Scientific Intelligence — an AI framework that deeply **fuses knowledge and data** to enable machines not only to learn the laws of nature but also to discover them.

I strive to connect **theory, experiment, and application** through an integrated scientific learning system capable of reasoning, inference, and innovation.
The ultimate goal is to develop AI systems that act as true **“AI Scientists”**, advancing scientific discovery from experience-driven to intelligence-driven processes.

I. Knowledge–Data Integration: The Core Architecture of Scientific Intelligence
------
This research direction focuses on constructing a unified architecture that deeply integrates **human knowledge** and **data-driven learning**, enabling AI systems to learn and reason under physical principles while retaining computational efficiency and interpretability.

The framework is powered by two synergistic mechanisms:

1. **Knowledge Embedding**, which incorporates governing equations, conservation laws, and domain constraints into AI models to ensure that predictions are physically consistent, mathematically accurate, and computationally stable; and

2. **Knowledge Discovery**, which employs symbolic reasoning and reinforcement learning to autonomously extract and represent governing equations from observational or experimental data.

Together, these two mechanisms form **a self-evolving architecture** that continuously bridges knowledge and data.
It breaks the traditional divide between discrete symbolic semantic space (such as equations and qualitative rules) and continuous vector feature space (such as neural representations), realizing a seamless fusion of knowledge-driven and data-driven paradigms.

As a result, this framework transforms AI models from black boxes into white boxes represented by explicit knowledge and governing equations—
achieving a new generation of **scientific machine learning models** that are physically grounded, mathematically precise, and computationally efficient.

II. AI-Assisted Fluid Mechanics: Intelligent Modeling and Aerodynamic Design
------
This research direction integrates **artificial intelligence and fluid mechanics** to develop new methods for high-fidelity, data-efficient flow modeling and intelligent aerodynamic optimization.

We focus on enabling **AI-driven turbulence modeling**, achieving high-accuracy simulations under small-sample and noisy conditions. The developed models can reconstruct fine-scale turbulent structures through super-resolution techniques and predict flow evolution over time with high efficiency and physical consistency.

In addition, my team has established an **AI-based aerodynamic design framework** that enables rapid drag prediction, pressure field estimation, and 3D vehicle shape generation and optimization. By coupling physical constraints with deep learning, this system allows end-to-end aerodynamic analysis and design iteration—accelerating innovation in vehicle design and intelligent manufacturing.

Together, these advances demonstrate how AI can serve as a bridge between physics-based understanding and engineering application, providing new tools for efficient, interpretable, and physically consistent fluid modeling.

III. Autonomous Experimental Platforms: Enabling Embodied Scientific Discovery
------
We are developing an **autonomous experimental platform** that integrates robotics, sensing, and AI decision-making to achieve closed-loop, self-driven physical and chemical experimentation.

This embodied system automates experiment design, sample preparation, data acquisition, and parameter optimization.
By coupling it with knowledge-discovery algorithms, the platform can infer new physical and chemical laws directly from experimental data.

It is more than an automated laboratory — it is a **learning experimental intelligence** capable of generating hypotheses, conducting experiments, and refining knowledge,
marking a step toward high-throughput, intelligent, and self-evolving science.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
